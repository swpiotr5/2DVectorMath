This project implements operations on 2D vectors using object-oriented programming. It includes functionality for representing vectors in Cartesian and polar coordinates, as well as performing scalar and vector products.

## Features
- Representation of 2D vectors in Cartesian and polar coordinate systems.
- Calculation of the scalar product of two vectors.
- Calculation of the vector product (using matrix methods).
- Display of results for all possible vector combinations.

## Usage
1. Create 2D vector objects with selected coordinates.
2. Use the implemented methods to:
   - Convert between Cartesian and polar coordinates.
   - Calculate scalar and vector products.
3. View results in the console.

## Example
In the `main()` function, three sample vectors are created, and their properties and operations are displayed in the output.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and execute the program in your chosen language.
3. Follow the prompts to view the results.

## Notes
- Vector cross product is implemented using matrix-based methods.
- Z-coordinate for 2D vectors is assumed to be 0.
